Freecad: Thermal simulation 
#############################
HanishKVC, v20201119IST1913

Create Part
=============

New -> Part Design

Create body -> Create Sketch -> Select plane (maybe say xy)

Draw the sketch

Pad it

Add to it, or Substract from it.

Thermal analysis
==================

Switch to FEM

Add a Analysis

Create a FEM Mesh for the part

Specify the material used for making the part. It needs to have info about thermal conductivity, specific heat, ...

Constraints

	Initial temperature

	Any temperature acting or there in any subpart (or full) of the part.

In the Solver???Tools

	Select analysis type (Thermo Mech)

	Whether to simulate till thermo mech steady state or not

	If not thermo mech steady state, then

		End Time and Step Time till which it should simulate


	THEN RUN SOLVER


Handling results

	Select one of the generated results (the time within simulation/modeling at which you want to see how temperature behaved)

	Click on Show result

	Select temperature in the dialog, to see the impact of all the temperatures on the part.

Limitations

	Currently it doesnt support more than 1 part or rather more than 1 mesh, so work around it where possible.
