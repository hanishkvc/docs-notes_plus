<h2> Whats required to support <b>a language</b> in computers </h2>
<ol>
<li> [Binary representation] A character encoding standard, which identifies 
     the characters of the language to their binary representation in the 
     computer.
<li> [Output] A font which maps these characters to their respective glyphs.
<li> [Input] A keyboard mapping which converts
  <ol>
  <li> scancode to the language character encoding (at a lower level)
  <li> From one Character encoding to another (at a higher level)
  </ol>
</ol>

<hr>
<h2> How to support <b>multiple languages</b> simultaneously </h2>
<ul>
<li> Character Encoding
  <ol> 
  <li> [Internal tagging] A unified Character encoding standard, 
       for the given set of languages. <br>
       Say UNICODE (Even with its quircks).
  <li> [External tagging] The character strings are tagged using 
       some predefined keywords.
  </ol>
<li> Output
  <ol>
  <li> A font which provides glyphs for all the languages
  <li> A system which changes fonts as required depending on the 
       language character being displayed
  </ol>
<li> Input
  <ol>
  <li> On the fly Keyboard mapper 
  <li> a OnScreen keyboard
  </ol>
</ul>

<ol>
<li> Use gettext to add internationalization in Linux apps
  <ol>
  <li> Intelligently identify the strings that require to be translated
       within gettext() function
  <li> Use special functions which adapt to the currently set locale
  <li> Run xgettext on the files to generate the pot file
  </ol>
<li> Steps to do the translation.
  <ol>
  <li> POT files contain the strings that require to be translated
       <ol>
       <li> These files contain the string to be translated - identified by msgid "blah blah"
       <li> and the space for the translated string - identified by msgstr ""
       <li> Translate the string identified by msgid and place it infront of msgstr. 
       </ol>
  <li> Download and Install the TrueType font for your language, 
       The font used should be the one specified in this website.
  <li> In gfontkb or GEdit or Notepad or any editor which supports
       selection of fonts, Have this font selected.
  <li> Type in the translated string in your language into either 
       gfontkb or GEdit or Notepad ..., depending on which ever you use. <br>
       NOTE: You should be seeing what ever you enter in your language,
       else, something is wrong. Please verify the above steps once
       again.
  <li> Have the POT file whose Message Strings you are translating 
       opened in a text editor like vi or emacs. <br>
       (if using emacs, be careful about the po mode, understand it 
        properly if u use it).
  <li> Cut and paste the translated string from gfontkb or GEdit or 
       ... into the POT file opened in vi or emacs or any plain text 
       editor of your choice.
  <li> The translated string which you pasted into the POT file in
       vi(or emacs or plain text editor of your choice) will appear
       in english (or which ever language you use by default) with
       maybe few strange characters in it. <br>
       This is fine, because your editor is showing the string in
       translated language as if its in english.
  </ol>
  If in doubt, you can always verify the info pages on gettext, available 
  in your system. (bash$ info gettext)
<li> Provide translated messages for the application for the given language
  <ol>
  <li> Run msgmerge to merge the new template with previous translated po file
  <li> Run msgfmt to generate the binary mo file from the po file
  <li> Install the mo file in respective locale directory <br>
       /usr/share/locale/LL/LC_MESSAGES/application.mo
  </ol>
