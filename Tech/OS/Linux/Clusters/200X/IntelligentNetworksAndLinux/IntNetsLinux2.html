Quote from LVS guys "Clusters of servers, connected by a fast network,
are emerging as a viable architecture for building a high-performance and
highly available server. This type of loosely coupled architecture is more
scalable, more cost-effective and more reliable than a single processor
system or a tightly coupled multiprocessor system."
