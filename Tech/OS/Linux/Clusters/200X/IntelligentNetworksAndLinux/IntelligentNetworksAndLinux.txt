Intelligent Networks
--------------------
a) Good Networks of computers
b) Good networked Computers

A collection | cluster of computers which can take care of changing network structures, Failures, Loadsharing, Distributed computing power, ...  

Or shall we say High Performance, High Availability & Effective utilization of
available resources.

Where do we need them
---------------------

a) High activity sites on the net
b) Critical servers in an Intranet or Business setup 
c) Processing intensive problems
d) Local Area Network
...

Quote from LVS guys "Clusters of servers, connected by a fast network, are emerging as a viable architecture for building a high-performance and highly available server. This type of loosely coupled architecture is more scalable, more cost-effective and more reliable than a single processor system or a tightly coupled multiprocessor system."

How Linux fits
--------------

a) Open nature of code in Linux & its easy availability
b) Availability of different networking protocol stacks 
c) Support for wide variety of Hardware
d) Simplicity in adding support for new Hardware or Systems

The future demands it
---------------------

a) Humans are social beings, we like to interact
b) DeCentralization helps
c) Future computing requirements & Economics

Current status
--------------

a) Layered architecture
b) Adoptation of a open and good protocol as standard
c) Support packages for Distributed systems

Say things like TCP - UDP, IP, DNS, DHCP, RPC, Corba - DCom, PVM - MPI, MOSIX, ...

Things in progress or yet to do
-------------------------------

a) Intelligent Component architecture
b) Intelligent DNS - DHCP communication
c) Cross platform Distributed computing architecture
d) Virtual servers or better still Virtual systems
e) Endpoint identity, Transaction identity, Privacy or Security

Implementation Issues
---------------------

From Applications point of view

a) Passive setups
   No change required for applications, But 
   the Network and the systems take care of it.
b) Active setups
   Applications require to actively utilize 
   the resources available in the network.
   
Passive setups
--------------

a) From network angle
   ARP spoofing => IP takeover
   Pulse or Heartbeat => Sense failure of service
   Controller => Distribute load & Assure Failsafe
   NFS => Availability of critical data across m/cs
       => Distribution of critical data (& load balancing) across m/cs
   DNS - DHCP => Managing a  dynamic network
   LVS => A linux kernel solution
b) From system point
   Mosix, Raid, Multiple network cards, 

Active setups
-------------

a) Packages for Interaction of systems over a network 
   Sockets, RPC, PVM, MPI, Corba - DCom
b) Managing a Dynamic system
   Aglets++, PVM, Mosix,
