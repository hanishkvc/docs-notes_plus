<a href="linux-2.6.0-test4-hkvc-26aug2003-1734.patch"> the kernel patch </a>
<br>
<ol>This patch contains:
  <li>slight addition to show_trace in traps.c so that it prints 
      the distance between the functions in the stack interms of
      words.
  <li>addition of mutexks.c and mutexks.h files which provide the
      mutexks logic
  <li>a small patch to sched.c so that it doesn't ignore the preempt_count
      unless the mutualExclusionOnlyFlag is set. <this again is a temporary
      fix till people requiring mutual exclusion move to using mutexks
      or similar logic.
  <li>a hack or BAD FIX to scsi_error.c so that the current problem in it is
      solved TEMPORARILY. The actual fix would involve moving the code to 
      use mutexks or similar where ever required.

The story ;-) <br>
The way linux implements spinlocks in UniProcessor configuration, the semantic
of spinlocks changes from a mechanism which provides Mutual Exclusion (ME) to 
one which provides Exclusive Execution (EE). So I have wondered wouldn't it 
affect code which expects ME. But in 2.4 I didn't find any issue related to
this on my machine. However with the latest 2.6.0 kernel I had some surprises.
<p>
When I tried 2.6.0 kernel I found that when querying my ide cdrom drives, for
one of the drives in test3 it used to dump few stack traces and later crash. 
However with test4 it dumps few stack traces <br>
<p>
<a href="schedinatomic-3-dmesg.log"> trace 1 - captured using dmesg </a>. I 
have identified the contents of the call trace dumped in the log file, which 
correspond to function pointers in the stack of other functions. <br>
<a href="schedinatomic-4-dmesg.log"> trace 2 - captured using dmesg (has one part of my fix) </a> <br>
and then continues with its job. 

<p>
So one analysing the call trace from test4 with the source and binary code, I 
realized that the reason this is happening is because of the spinlock no longer
being a ME logic but having become a EE logic in uniprocessor configurations. 

<p>
So I have come up with a solution to this problem by implementing what
<a href="mutex_ks.txt"> I call MUTEXKS </a> for mutual exclusion in 
kernelspace. Which is nothing but integration of existing spinlock and 
semaphore logics in the kernel into a single entity which behaves like a 
spinlock in SMP configurations and a semaphore in UniProcessor configurations. 
<br>
You can read about it in the link provided above.<br>
<p>
Here is a <a href="tempfix-schedinatomic-5-dmesg.log"> dmesg log after my fix </a> (this is a temporary hack, as the proper implementation will involve 
changing to many locations in the scsci layer to use mutexks where appropriate
rather than spinlocks, and its better left to the people who maintain it, as
they know the flow there better).
